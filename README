Repose is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for PHP5. Repose implements
a Unit of Work (UoW), an Identity Map and generated proxy classes to provide
transparent unobtrusive persistence in PHP.

The only requirement on model classes are that they not be marked as final and
for PHP 5.2.x and earlier the persistence aware properties need to be public.
There are no framework classes or interfaces that need to be extended or
implemented in order to use Repose.
