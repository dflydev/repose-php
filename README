Repose ORM for PHP

Repose is an ORM tool for PHP. Similar to Hibernate and SQLAlchemy and inspired
by Outlet, another ORM tool for PHP.

Repose's goal is to provide developers with a tool to aid in persisting object
data in a relational database. Reposes provides Unit of Work (UoW) and
Object-Relational-Mapping (ORM) while attempting to remain as unobtrusive to
the domain model as possible. Repose is still very early in its development,
but so far the only restrictions on the domain model are that the classes are
not marked final and properties are not marked private. Beyond that, there are
no other restrictions on the classes and they may be more or less Plain Old
PHP Objects (POPO).
